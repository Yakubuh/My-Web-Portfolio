         <h1>I am a Web App Developer And a Physicist</h1>
        <p>Meet Mr. Bayulu Yakubu, a brilliant physicist and web developer
           who combines his passion for science and technology to innovate in both fields.
           I always had a fascination with the natural world and how it works. I pursued 
           this interest by obtaining a Bsc. in Physics from a top university in Ghana
           Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science And  Technology (KNUST), 
           where I specialized in physics with computing. 
           My research focused on developing mathematical models to understand the 
           behavior of complex systems and their properties and also develop a system 
           to help students to easily simulate certain concepts in physics.</p>

      <H2>ABOUT</H2>
  <p>I am a <strong> physicist</strong> and <strong>web developer</strong> who has found a way to combine my love for science and technology. I was always 
    fascinated by the workings of the universe and the laws that governed it. I pursued my studies in physics and completed 
    my <strong>Bsc. in physics</strong>  from a prestigious university.
    After completing my studies, I was looking for a way to apply my knowledge of physics to practical problems. 
    I was drawn to the world of web development, where I could use my skills to solve real-world problems using technology.
     I started learning web development on my own and soon became proficient in programming languages like <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> .        
    As I honed my skills, I began to apply my knowledge of physics to the development of web applications. </p>
